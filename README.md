# RDA-TIGER

This repository contains code related to my time working on the RDA-TIGER project.
The RDA Zenodo API Access notebook contains a function that queries the Zenodo API for information related to RDA resources and returns them in a format compatible with the RDA WP4 dataset.
The Resource Keyword Creation notebook contains code that uses NLTK to generate keyword phrases for RDA resource documents.
